"""Real xArm7 over the UFACTORY controller, implementing the RobotInterface API.

This is the hardware twin of `xarm7_mujoco.SimulatedXArm7`: same methods, same
units (radians, radians/second, newton-metres), same joint ordering. Swapping
one for the other should be a one-line change in a script.

Everything goes through `xarm.wrapper.XArmAPI`. The controller runs the servo
loop itself, so unlike the simulator there is no reference shaping or gravity
feedforward here — the three motion commands are just the controller's three
motion modes, and the work is in switching between them cleanly:

    set_joint_targets  mode 0, position control. `set_servo_angle` plans a
                       time-synchronized joint move at the requested speed and
                       the controller's acceleration.
    set_velocity       mode 4, joint velocity control. `vc_set_joint_velocity`
                       holds the commanded speeds until they are replaced or
                       until `duration` expires (firmware >= 1.8.0 expires them
                       on the controller; older firmware is timed here).
    servo_joints       mode 1, servo streaming. `set_servo_angle_j` applies the
                       setpoint at the next control tick with no planning.

A mode change is only accepted while the arm is stopped, so `_ensure_mode`
first cancels whatever is running — zero velocities in mode 4, a state-4 abort
of the queued trajectory in mode 0 — and waits for the joints to come to rest.
That makes a new command supersede the previous one, which is what the
simulator does too.

State comes off the controller's report stream, so the readings are up to one
report period stale — and that period is a good deal longer than it takes to
issue a command, so nothing here decides that a move is over from a fixed
number of consecutive polls. `joint_efforts` is the exception: it is a live
request/response round trip, which makes it far slower than the others and a
poor thing to poll in a tight loop.

The mode the SDK reports comes off that same stream, and `set_mode` doesn't
update it, so a mode change isn't finished until a report confirms it: while
the SDK still believes the arm is in the previous mode, its own blocking wait
in `set_servo_angle` returns immediately instead of waiting.

Servo mode has no watchdog on this end. The controller rejects setpoints that
jump too far in one tick, so a stream that stalls and resumes will fault rather
than lunge, but pacing the stream is still the caller's job.

Every mode is checked for self-collision and against the safety box before
anything is sent (see `safety.py`), and a command that would break either is
refused with `SafetyError` rather than started and stopped part-way. The
simulator, by contrast, runs such a command and halts at the boundary — so
anything it merely warns about is something this class will reject outright.

The controller has its own self-collision detection, which is switched on here
as a backstop. It only covers planned moves in mode 0 though: the setpoints in
mode 1 and the velocities in mode 4 aren't planned, so for those the check on
this end is the only one there is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ip : controller address, e.g. "192.168.1.185".
    acceleration : joint acceleration for `set_joint_targets`, rad/s^2.
        Defaults to the controller's own default (500 deg/s^2 ~ 8.7 rad/s^2).
    velocity_limit : cap applied to every commanded joint speed, rad/s. The
        controller's own reported limit is used instead when it is lower.
    position_limit : joint ranges (7, 2), rad. Normally read from the SDK's
        table for the connected model; pass it when the arm reports a model
        that isn't in that table, or to work inside a tighter envelope.
    clear_errors : clear a latched controller error/warning on connect. With
        this off, connecting to an arm that is in an error state raises.
    timeout : seconds to wait for the report stream to come up on connect.
    arm : an already-connected `XArmAPI` to adopt instead of opening one.
        `close()` then leaves it connected — whoever opened it owns it.
    safety_box : ((x_min, x_max), (y_min, y_max), (z_min, z_max)) in metres,
        which the whole arm must stay inside. None allows it anywhere it can
        reach; self-collision is still refused.
    safety_margin : clearance in metres at which the check trips.
    guard : refuse commands that would self-collide or leave the box. With this
        off you are left with the controller's own detection, which does not
        cover servo or velocity commands.
    controller_boundary : also hand the box to the controller as its reduced-mode
        TCP boundary. Off by default: it constrains only the tool where the box
        here constrains the whole arm, and switching reduced mode on also caps
        the arm's speed, which is a surprising thing to inherit from setting a
        box.
