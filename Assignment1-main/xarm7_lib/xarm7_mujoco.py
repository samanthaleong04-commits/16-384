"""Simulated xArm7 on MuJoCo, implementing the RobotInterface API.

Physics is MuJoCo stepping the Menagerie xarm7 MJCF (arm + gripper);
visualization is meshcat, driven by `mujoco_meshcat.MeshcatVisualizer`. The
simulation runs on a background thread paced to wall time, and the scene shows
up in a browser tab.

Control is MuJoCo's own position actuators — the MJCF already declares one per
joint, so `data.ctrl[i] = angle` is the whole interface. Two thin layers sit on
top of that, per tick:

    reference   the setpoint ramps toward the goal at `speed` rather than
                snapping to it; a snapped setpoint whips the arm to ~9 rad/s
                (3x the joint velocity limit) with the motors saturated
    feedforward the setpoint is offset by the torque the servo would otherwise
                have to develop an error to produce:
                    ctrl = q_ref + (bias + friction + kv v_ref) / kp
                without it the arm droops ~0.9 deg under gravity and never
                reaches its target

The compensation goes through the servo setpoint rather than around it, so
`data.actuator_force` still reports the true motor torque (gravity holding
torque included) and MuJoCo still clamps it to the model's force range.

`qfrc_bias` is read from the previous tick's forward pass, which is one
timestep stale — worth ~0.1% of the gravity term at full speed, and it saves a
redundant `mj_forward` per step.

Every mode is guarded against self-collision and against leaving the safety box
(see `safety.py`), and every mode is guarded in the same place: `_update_reference`
is the one funnel all three run through, so the check goes on the setpoint just
before it is committed. When the next setpoint would be unsafe the old one is
kept and the arm holds — it coasts to a stop at the boundary rather than being
refused up front, which is the behaviour worth having in a simulator: the motion
happens, is visible, and stops where it should. A warning says what was hit.

The real arm refuses these commands outright instead. Anything the simulator
merely warns about is something the hardware will reject.

The MJCF carries a gripper the real arm doesn't. `gripper=False` takes it out
of both the picture and the contact set; its mass stays either way, standing in
for whatever is actually bolted on. Turning it back on gives you a gripper the
guard knows nothing about, so the simulator can then jam on a part no check will
warn you about — which is why the flange is bare by default.

class SimulatedXArm7(RobotInterface):
    """A simulated xArm7.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mjcf_path : MJCF to load. Defaults to the Menagerie xarm7 description.
    dt : physics timestep, seconds. Defaults to the model's own timestep.
    q0 : initial arm configuration (7,). Defaults to all zeros; pass
        `keyframe="home"` instead to start from the MJCF's home pose.
    keyframe : name or index of an MJCF keyframe to reset into.
    visualize : publish the scene to meshcat and open it in a browser tab.
    real_time : run the sim in a background thread paced to wall time. When
        False the sim only advances inside `step()` (or while a blocking call
        waits on it), which makes runs deterministic and as fast as the CPU
        allows.
    gravity : include gravity in the dynamics.
    feedforward : compensate gravity/Coriolis/friction through the servo
        setpoint. With this off you get the MJCF's raw position servos, which
        droop under gravity and lag during motion — useful for testing how a
        controller copes, but then a move may never reach its target within
        tolerance.
    safety_box : ((x_min, x_max), (y_min, y_max), (z_min, z_max)) in metres,
        which the whole arm must stay inside. None allows the arm anywhere it
        can reach.
    safety_margin : clearance in metres at which the guard trips.
    guard : check every setpoint for self-collision and box violations. Turning
        this off lets the arm drive into itself, which the real one won't do.
    gripper : keep the MJCF's gripper. Off by default, matching the bare flange
        the guard and the real arm assume; on, it is drawn and collides, but
        the guard still doesn't model it.
