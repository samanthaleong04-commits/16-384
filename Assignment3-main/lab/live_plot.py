"""The live top-down plot of the planar RR arm, drawn with the student's FK.

One view, used twice:

    LivePlot()              `record.py`: the arm as it is hand-guided,
                            and the path recorded.
    LivePlot(planned=True)  `replay.py`: the same, plus the recorded path it
                            is meant to follow.

The arm is drawn from the planar RR angles alone: `robot_info.py` gives the
link lengths, and `fk.py` turns the angles into points. Callers holding a
7-joint configuration convert it with `robot_info.rr_angles` first.

Hand a pair of joint *velocities* in alongside the angles and the end
effector's own velocity is drawn there too, as an arrow off the tip — the
student's `jacobian_RR` applied to those joint velocities. `robot_info.qd2rr`
converts a 7-joint velocity the same way `q2rr` converts a configuration.
